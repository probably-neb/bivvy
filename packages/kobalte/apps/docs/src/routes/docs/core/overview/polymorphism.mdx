# Polymorphism

All component parts that render a DOM element have an `asChild` prop.

Paired with the `<As>` component this allows you to attach a component accessibility and functional requirements onto your own element instead.

When using this pattern the following rules apply to the component with the `asChild` prop, and it's child `<As>` component :

- CSS classes are combined.
- Styles are combined, if same attribute exists the one from `<As>` win.
- Event handlers are chained, The one from `<As>` get called first.

<Callout type="warning">
  If you decide to change the default rendered node (e.g. change a `button` to a `div`) then it's up
  to you to ensure the correct accessibility and functionality of your chosen node type.
</Callout>

## With HTML elements

You can use any HTML element with the `As` component. For example, `a` tag will render an anchor:

```tsx
import { As, Popover as KPopover } from "@kobalte/core";

function App() {
  return (
    <KPopover.Trigger asChild>
      <As component="a" href="/">
        Trigger
      </As>
    </KPopover.Trigger>
  );
}
```

## With other components

You can also use polymorphic components with any other component. For example, with `@solidjs/router` Link:

```tsx
import { As, Popover as KPopover } from "@kobalte/core";
import { Link } from "@solidjs/router";

function App() {
  return (
    <KPopover.Trigger asChild>
      <As component={Link} href="/">
        Trigger
      </As>
    </KPopover.Trigger>
  );
}
```

## The `as` prop

For simple use cases where you **just need to change the rendered DOM node** in order to produce valid HTML the `as` prop can be used:

```tsx {6}
import { Tabs as KTabs } from "@kobalte/core";

function App() {
  return (
    <KTabs.Root>
      <KTabs.List>
        <KTabs.Trigger value="one" as="div">
          <button>Trigger one</button>
        </KTabs.Trigger>
      </KTabs.List>
      <KTabs.Content value="one">Content one</KTabs.Content>
    </KTabs.Root>
  );
}
```
